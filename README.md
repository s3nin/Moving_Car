# Moving_Car
This is a small animated project that attempts to feature a moving car. It displays the movement of a car
on a road in front of a building under the daytime sky.
The following algorithms are used:
1. The car and building are represented using the rectangle algorithm.
2. The sun and the wheels of the car are depicted using the circle-drawing algorithm.
3. Roads are drawn using the line drawing algorithm.
4. Lastly, all the objects and spaces are filled using the flood fill algorithm.
Every time the loop operates, the window is cleared, and a delay function is utilized to move the scene.
